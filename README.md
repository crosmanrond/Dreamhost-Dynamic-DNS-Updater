Dreamhost-Dynamic-DNS-Updater
=============================

A work-in-progress to create a Windows Service that will update Dreamhost's DNS entries.

To install, run msbuild.exe on the solution (requires allowing NuGet to restore packages) and then run `DHDns.Service.exe install` from a command line.
