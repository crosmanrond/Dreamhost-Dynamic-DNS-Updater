Dreamhost-Dynamic-DNS-Updater
=============================

A small Windows Service that will update Dreamhost's DNS entries to point to your home machine.

## Building ##

The project is built using C# in Visual Studio 2012. You can also build the project using `msbuild` via the `build.cmd` script in the root of the project.

Simple logging is doing via NLog to `Logging.log` where the executable is run, but can be configured via *NLog.config*.

## Installation ##

After the project is built, add your DreamHost API key and host information into the app.config file.

Run `install.cmd` from the root of the directory from the command line to install the Windows Service.

## Notes ##

Currently, there is no real exception handling in place and the log configuration is the only real output of the service.
